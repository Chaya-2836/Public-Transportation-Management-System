# P×•ublic Transportation Management System
This project showcases a public transportation management system built with Java and Spring Boot.
It handles the core elements of a transit network: lines, stations, drivers, buses, and scheduled travels.
The development focused on a well-structured data model and clear business logic, including support for ordered relationships such as line routes.
The implementation includes services for managing travel scheduling and route structure, with clean, maintainable code.
The architecture is built to support future growth and extension, while maintaining simplicity and clarity.
The project demonstrates strong backend development practices using Spring and JPA, with careful attention to system structure.
It serves as a solid foundation for infrastructure-oriented applications and has the potential to grow into a full end-to-end solution.
